**PLP PYTHON DAY 4: File Reader & Modifier**  
This Python script reads the content of a file, modifies it (by converting it to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file. It also handles file errors gracefully.  

### **Operations Performed**  
- **Reading a File**: Reads content from a specified input file.  
- **Modifying Content**: Converts the content to uppercase (can be changed as needed).  
- **Writing to a New File**: Saves the modified content to an output file.  
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the input file is missing or unreadable.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the script in a Python environment.  
2. Enter the name of the input file when prompted.  
3. Enter the name of the output file where the modified content will be saved.  
4. The script will process the file and display a success message.  

### **Example Output**  
```
Enter the name of the file to read: input.txt  
Enter the name of the file to write the modified content to: output.txt  
File 'input.txt' has been read and modified content written to 'output.txt'.  
```

### **Notes**  
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
- The input file must exist in the same directory as the script or provide the full path.  
- Modify the script to apply different text transformations if needed.
